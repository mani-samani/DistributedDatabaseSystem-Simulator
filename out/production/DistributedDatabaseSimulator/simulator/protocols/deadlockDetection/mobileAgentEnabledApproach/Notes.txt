Each site keeps its local WFG, it does not send its WFG to other sites.
It does however, have entries in its local WFG for locks on other sites. -> So when a lock is blocked remotely it must send a message informing the requester this lock is blocked and by which process.

DD starts when an edge becomes too old. -> event is added
DD occurs locally when an edge is not cleared within a certain timeout time.

Section 4
 - "Adopted model is the single-resource model, in which a process has only one outgoing request at a time. Hence it can be involved in just one deadlock cycle."
